‚ö° Electric Scooter (BLDC Motor Powered)
This project showcases a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor-powered electric scooter built for efficient, quiet, and eco-friendly urban mobility. The scooter is powered by a high-torque BLDC motor, controlled by an intelligent motor driver and powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. It offers a reliable, low-maintenance alternative to traditional gasoline-powered scooters.

üöÄ Features
BLDC Motor: High efficiency, longer lifespan, and silent operation.

Lithium-ion Battery: Rechargeable, lightweight, and capable of fast charging.

Digital Display: Shows speed, battery status, and system diagnostics.

Regenerative Braking: Converts kinetic energy back into stored power.

Eco & Sport Modes: Customize ride performance for range or power.
